    <h1>Locro De Papa</h1>
    <img src="/images/locro-de-papa.jpg" alt="locro de papa" class="img">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of the most delicious dishes of Ecuadorian gastronomy is, 
        without a doubt, the “locro de papas”, 
        a delicious potato stew that can contain cheese and skin, 
        and that is served together with avocado and toasted corn.
    </p> 
 
    <p>It has a creamy consistency and its incomparable flavor makes this 
        soup a true delicacy that must be tried if you are visiting Ecuador. 
        In fact, if you don't have cheese or shells, 
        it's a great vegetarian option or a healthy vegan alternative.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>½ liter of milk</li>
            <li>¼ grated cheese</li>
            <li>2 long onion sprigs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of achiote oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon 3 sprigs of cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>salt and cumin to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Preparation</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot we prepare a refried sauce that will be the 
                base of the flavor of this locro, for this we put the achiote,
                let it heat up a bit and add the finely chopped onion, 
                add the cumin, salt and mix.</li>
            <li>Peel and chop the potatoes into small squares, add the refried 
                potatoes to the potatoes and fry for approximately 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>We pour water and cover the pot, cook for about 20 minutes, 
                after this time with the help of a potato masher or a fork 
                we crush them, however, 
                remember that what we are going to do is not a cream but a locro, 
                therefore , we will not make it totally pure, 
                we have to have a few pieces of potatoes.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes have been crushed, 
                add the milk and let it cook for a few more minutes over low heat, 
                mixing from time to time.</li>
            <li>We check its texture and if it is too thick we add more milk or 
                water according to our taste of thickness, add the cheese and salt, 
                correct the flavor and turn it off.</li>
            <li>We serve with a decoration of sliced avocado in the center and a 
                little extra cheese, we can also accompany it with a little toasted 
                corn.</li>
        </ol>
